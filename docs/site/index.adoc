== Motivation
This project stems from personal experiences in the world of slot car racing. A
notable gap in the hobby is the predominance of closed-source and often unmaintained
or platform-dependent software tools.

The core objective is to develop a versatile, open-source race management system.
This system aims to accommodate a variety of vendors, including Scalextric, Carrera,
and Oxigen.

A key feature of OpenRMS is its community-driven nature. We envision a platform
where enthusiasts can contribute and enhance functionalities as needed. This could
range from improved Arduino integration to innovative features like track-wide yellow
flag alerts in the event of a car crash.

An essential aspect of OpenRMS is its platform independence. Our vision is to enable
seamless operation on low-cost hardware like the Raspberry Pi, thus bypassing the
need for expensive computers with specific operating system licenses. Our ambition
is to release versions compatible with Mac OS, Linux, and Windows, catering to a
broad user base.
