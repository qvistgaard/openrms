= Commentary Plugin Documentation

== Overview

The Commentary plugin in OpenRMS enriches the race management experience by enabling AI-generated audio commentary.
This feature, powered by the Play.ht service, allows other plugins to generate dynamic commentary based on the events occurring during the race, enhancing the immersion and spectator engagement.

== Configuration

To enable and configure the Commentary plugin, update the `plugins` section of your `config.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]

plugins:
  commentary:
    enabled: true    # Enable the Commentary plugin
    playht:
      apiKey: <your_api_key>  # API key from Play.ht
      userId: <your_user_id>  # User ID from Play.ht
----

=== Enabling the Plugin

Set `enabled` to `true` to activate the Commentary plugin.
This setting allows other plugins within OpenRMS to utilize AI-generated commentary during races.

=== Playht Configuration

Configure the connection to the Play.ht service for AI audio generation.

- `apiKey`: Your personal API key from Play.ht, obtained after signing up at https://play.ht.

== Additional Notes

- Keep your API key and User ID confidential to secure your access to the Play.ht service.
