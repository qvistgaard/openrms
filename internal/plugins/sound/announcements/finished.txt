That's it! The checkered flag waves, signaling the end of the race and the start of the search for the nearest restroom.
They've hit the lap limit, and not a moment too soon. The cars were about to start asking for overtime pay!
Race over! Time to hit the brakes, both literally and figuratively. First one to the pit-stop shower wins!
And we've reached the end! Like a good binge-watch session, it's over too soon and leaves you wanting more.
That's all, folks! Cars crossing the finish line like they're rushing to catch a Black Friday sale.
The final lap's done! Drivers now have permission to unbuckle and breathe again. First one to sigh relief wins!
And it's a wrap! Like the end of a family dinner, everyone's eager to leave but no one knows how to say goodbye.
There's the flag! The race is finished, and not a moment too soon for those with a 'need for feed.' Snack time!
Finished at last! Cars gliding to a stop like they've just been told there's cake in the pit lane.
End of the road! Drivers now switching from race mode to 'Where did I park again?' mode.
That's the end! Like a long Monday, it felt like it would never come, and yet here we are.
And it's officially over, like a diet on Thanksgiving. Time to hit the buffet, folks!
The race concludes! Cars slowing down as if they've just seen the price of gas at the next pump.
Final lap? Check. Mad dash to the finish? Check. Now, where's the nearest pizza place?
And we're done here! Like the end of a good book, you're sad it's over but glad you were part of the journey.
That's it, race over! Drivers are now free to roam about the cabin... or the pit lane, more accurately.
The checkered flag signals the end, and possibly the start of a few 'I could've been a contender' stories.
And they've crossed the finish line, ready to exchange their helmets for hats and their cars for couches. What a race!
