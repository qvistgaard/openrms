# OpenRMS
OpenRMS is an open platform for Slot car Race Management written in Go.

## Motivation
The motivation for starting this project is, my experience getting into
slot cars, and the software tooling around the hobby is for the most part
closed source, and in many cases unmaintained, platform dependent.

The idea is to create an open source race management system capable of
supporting multiple vendors such as Scalextric, Carrera or Oxigen.

Other than supporting as many vendors as possible, The community should
be extend OpenRMS with the features need, it could be better support for
Arduino, it could be having yellow flags light up around the track if a
car has crash.

Last it must be platform independent, the goal is to be able to run it
on a Raspberry Pi, eliminating the high entry price of a computer with
a Windows license. The goal is to release a version that will work on
both Mac OS, Linux and Windows
